MultiRL: A reinforcement learning framework for unparallel literary text multi-style transfer（project leader） 
·This project is an nlp project in the PBL of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Blended Learning project. I was awarded a $3500 PBL scholarship for the 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Blended Learning project under the leadership of Gary Becigneul, a former researcher in the MIT Natural Language Processing Group.
·A framework called MultiRL has been proposed, which extends the framework between two objectives to a dual learning framework between multiple objectives. Introduced a styleless vector representation of content as an intermediate step in the conversion between different styles. By using vectors to perform dual learning between multiple targets, each target receives multiple rewards in terms of style accuracy and content preservation, and is trained through reinforcement learning based on multiple mapping models. Implement transmission between multiple styles without parallel data.
