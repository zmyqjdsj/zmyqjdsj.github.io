MultiRL: A reinforcement learning framework for unparallel literary text multi-style transfer（project leader） 
·This project is an nlp project in the PBL of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Blended Learning project. I was awarded a $3500 PBL scholarship for the 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Blended Learning project under the leadership of Gary Becigneul, a former researcher in the MIT Natural Language Processing Group.
·A framework called MultiRL has been proposed, which extends the framework between two objectives to a dual learning framework between multiple objectives. Introduced a styleless vector representation of content as an intermediate step in the conversion between different styles. By using vectors to perform dual learning between multiple targets, each target receives multiple rewards in terms of style accuracy and content preservation, and is trained through reinforcement learning based on multiple mapping models. Implement transmission between multiple styles without parallel data.

Research on Park Emergency Refuge Planning Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (Project Leader)                       
·The project won the Beijing Campus Level Award for the 2022 College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program Project
·Conduct research on the disaster prevention and evacuation functions of personnel intensive organizations, select campuses with high demand for emergency evacuation as the research object, and comprehensively consider the distribution of personnel in the park during work, dining, and sleeping periods under three disaster forms: earthquake, fire, and military strikes. Plan medical treatment plans, and establish the shortest evacuation time based on the Double DQN algorithm in deep reinforcement learning A park emergency shelter planning model with the goal of optimal medical service plan and minimum planning cost, and its effectiveness was verified at a university in Beijing.
·As the first author, the paper has been submitted to scientific and technological innovation
