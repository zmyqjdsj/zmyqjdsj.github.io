I'm a senior student from [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/). 
You can find my CV here: [Chenlu Wang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

My two main research tasks are to develop a framework called MultiRL to achieve the transfer of multiple styles of text, and to use the DDQN algorithm in deep reinforcement learning to establish a park emergency shelter planning model with the goal of minimizing evacuation time, optimal medical service plan, and minimum planning cost.

My research interest includes Natural Language Processing,Deep Reinforcement Learning, machine learning, and War Gaming.

Part of the main courses: object-oriented programming and C++(91), data structure (87), computer network principles (87), database system principles (86), introduction to artificial intelligence (96), compilation principles (94), deep learning (92), embedded system design (86), machine learning and Python programming (87), operations research 1 (92), operations research 2 (85)
Participated in the Blended Learning program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Passed the Machine Learning, Modeling, and Simulation Principles course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the summer of 2021, with a grade of A
