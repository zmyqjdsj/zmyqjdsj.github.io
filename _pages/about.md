I'm a senior student from [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/). 
You can find my CV here: [Chenlu Wang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

I have two main research tasks.The first one is to develop a framework called MultiRL to achieve the transfer of multiple styles of text.

[Get code here](http://github.com/zmyqjdsj/Park-Emergency-Refuge-Planning-Based-on-Double-DQN)
And the second one to use the DDQN algorithm in deep reinforcement learning to establish a park emergency shelter planning model with the goal of minimizing evacuation time, optimal medical service plan, and minimum planning cost.

My research interest includes Natural Language Processing,Deep Reinforcement Learning, machine learning, and War Gaming.

Part of the main courses: object-oriented programming and C++(91), data structure (87), computer network principles (87), database system principles (86), introduction to artificial intelligence (96), compilation principles (94), deep learning (92), embedded system design (86), machine learning and Python programming (87), operations research 1 (92), operations research 2 (85)
Participated in the Blended Learning program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
[Passed the Machine Learning, Modeling, and Simulation Principles course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the summer of 2021, with a grade of A](https://xpro.mit.edu/certificate/4898183b-8bb6-475b-9a3d-487761744290/)
